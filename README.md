# Dynamic Meteorolgy Application- Built using ReactJS + Vite + CSS

Please enter a dream destination, hot or cold. Watch as the background dynamically changes.

This change happens due to the application being designed and built using an API corresponding with useState.

Resulting in depending on the location you enter and its current weather, it will display a hot or cold background image.

Simple, but cool(no pun).

Hope it makes you go book your next trip away!

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
